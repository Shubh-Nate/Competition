**What is a Kruskal’s Algorithm?**

•	Kruskal’s Algorithm is a famous greedy algorithm. It is used for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a given graph. To apply Kruskal’s algorithm, the given graph must be weighted, connected and undirected.

## A simple approach to implement a linear search is -

1. First, we have to traverse the array elements using a for loop.
2. In each iteration of for loop, compare the search element with the current array element, and -
3. If the element matches, then return the index of the corresponding array element.
4. If the element does not match, then move to the next element.
5. If there is no match or the search element is not present in the given array, return -1.
